# Starbucks-Sales-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
Welcome to the Starbucks Sales Data Analysis project! This project is focused on building a data-driven, interactive Power BI dashboard that provides deep insights into sales performance for a coffee shop chain (like Starbucks) across different dimensionsâ€” including time, location, product category, and order volume.

# Project Overview

   Identify MoM changes in order volume.
   Compute the order difference between the selected and previous months.

3. Total Quantity Sold Analysis
